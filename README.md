## Comparing individual stock trading strategies for risk tolerant investors
Application is an end to end system that starts with algorithm selection and parameterization, has complete backtest functionality, and provides extensive statistics and visualization of the results.

The Resilient-Algorithm-Trading-Strategies application features a React frontend, Django backend, and docker container running a flask server managing the open source LEAN engine for backtesting. We have included algorithms for risk tolerant investors using a Momentum Leverage strategy, but you can also create your own, upload it, and run it.

Features:

-Full user management, with signing up through the application or using Oauth2 to login. Backtests are unique to the user.

-Visualize algorithm results through static report images or interactive plots.

-Ready for any linux environment: host each component separately or together.

-ETF selection research based on temporal dissimilarity, historically strong growth, consistency of returns, and choosing strong performing but volatile assets, which is shown in the graph below.
